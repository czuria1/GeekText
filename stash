Created columns and entered them manually some ID numbers to make joint conditions for authors and books in MYSQL.
Deleted after another team mate created one already.
MYSQL code/////////

drop column ID;
//Not including adding manually part

Created sort method for top sellersand had success as it showed top sold books. Need to have MYSQL operational with react but we have 
working sort method for top sellers. Making seperate button for top sellers. Issue with that currently is can't see if its working or not 
due to react too MYSQL.
Partial code///
--This to find the top sellers 
select title
from book, inventory
where book.bookcode = inventory.bookcode
group by title
order by sum (onhand) desc;
